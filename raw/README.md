# Raw (original) data

Here is any original raw data that can't be downloaded directly by the data preparation code.

A single data file containing all Sleep and Dream Database dream reports was downloaded from the https://sleepanddreamdatabase.org web interface and compressed to minimize the size of the repository. A search was performed of the entire database. Since no direct download link is provided, they have to be stored here for loading into [prepare.ipynb](../prepare.ipynb). The search was performed at `2024-03-15T18:37:35+00:00`.

More specifically, the single data file [`dream-export.csv.xz`](dream-export.csv.xz) was generated by the following steps:

1. Went to [SDDb search page](https://sleepanddreamdatabase.org/search)
2. [Performed a "blank" search](https://sleepanddreamdatabase.org/search_results/%7B%22freeSearchOperators%22%3A[%22%22]%2C%22freeSearchWords%22%3A[[%22%22]]%2C%22keywordOperators%22%3A[%22%22]%2C%22startBce%22%3A%22false%22%2C%22endBce%22%3A%22false%22%7D) by leaving all search parameters empty and hitting the `Search` button
3. Hit the `Export CSV` button
4. Hit the `Skip and Export CSV` button
5. Compressed the CSV file using LZMA algorithm by running [`compress.py`](compress.py) in a conda environment generated from [`environment.yaml`](environment.yaml).
